## Intro
 


## Data

The data associated with this study can be found at [URL] and is described in detail within the paper. The data set encompasses over 2 billion pose instances, each paired with edge calls and metadata.

## Unsupervised behavioral analysis

Brief examples of analysis are available here illustrating how to load and analyze tracks. This pipeline heavily depends on work from Gordon Berman and Kanishk Jain both from the MATLAB implementation of [MotionMapper](https://github.com/gordonberman/MotionMapper) and the Python implementation [MotionMapperPy](https://github.com/bermanlabemory/motionmapperpy).

The main refinements of this pipeline is dealing with memory constraints of the original MotionMapperPy implementation, separating steps to allow for drastic speed increases with parallelization, and the utilization of Lomb-Scargle periodograms to identify periodic behaviors in addition to continuous wavelet transoforms (CWT).


### Pipeline 
The sequential run of the analysis pipeline is:

1. `sbatch input-processing.slurm` 
2. `sbatch wavelets.slurm`
3. `sbatch subsample_for_training.slurm`
4. `python lts-tsne-subsample-3.py`
4. `sbatch embed.slurm`
5. `python lts-tsne-watershed-5.py`

#### input-processing.slurm

This script takes the raw data, interpolates missing data, and smooths data as needed. It also splits the data to the individual flies and saves the data in a format that is easy to load.

#### wavelets.slurm

This script computes the wavelet transform of the data. It is a computationally expensive step and is parallelized over the flies as much as possible. 

#### subsample_for_training.slurm

Because subsampling directly requires a lot of memory, this script subsamples the data for training the embedding for each file. It is parallelized over the flies. This also calculates

#### lts-tsne-subsample-3.py

Generates training data and embeds the data using t-SNE. This training provides the model for the embedding of the full data set.

#### embed.slurm

This script embeds the full data set using the model generated in the previous step. It's **extremely** slow and is parallelized over the fly hours but still takes multiple days to run on a cluster.


## Tracking

We used [SLEAP](sleap.ai) for tracking the flies. The tracking code can be found in the tracking directory. The code is a slightly modified version that enables the input of MKV files.

The tracking process is parallelized over fly-hours to efficiently utilize GPU resources for variable-length data.


## Documentation

We also included documentation on experimental methods, including the media recipe, in the documents directory.
